# When to Use SQL and When to Use NoSQL

## Use SQL When:

- You need to perform complex queries with relationships between tables.
- Data integrity and transactions (ACID) are required.
- You are working with structured and well-defined data.

## Use NoSQL When:

- You are handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.
- High scalability and flexibility in schema are needed.
- Your application requires optimal performance for large-scale read and write operations.
